 *     listing — per-*repo* granularity, not per-file.
 * The reason is cost: the Gitea contents API (`GET …/contents/<path>`) carries
 * `sha`/`size` but no dependable per-file commit time across Gitea versions.
 * True per-file times would require a commits-API query per file
 * (`GET …/commits?path=<file>&limit=1`) — an N+1 fan-out over a whole kit tree.
 * The single repo-metadata read is the honest, cheap parity: "these files were

 * commits API (a tracked follow-up, intentionally out of scope here).
