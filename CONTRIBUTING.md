# Contributing to genie

Thanks for your interest. genie is a solo, AI-assisted open-source experiment —
contributions are welcome but the project is run best-effort by one maintainer.
Read this before opening a PR; it'll save us both time.

## The short version

1. **Open an issue first** for anything non-trivial. A quick "I'd like to add X —
   does that fit?" avoids wasted work.
2. **Branch** from `main`: `<type>/<short-slug>` (e.g. `feat/list-projects-tool`).
3. **Write tests.** New behavior needs a test. We use Vitest.
4. **Keep it green.** `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` must pass.
5. **Conventional Commits.** Your commit messages drive automated releases.
6. **Open a PR** with a clear description and link the issue (`Closes #NN`).

## Working agreement for AI agents

This repo is built largely by AI coding agents under maintainer review. If you
are an agent (or directing one), follow the full SDLC in
[`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md): plan → TDD → visual-validate (UI issues) → test
against the local service → adversarial self-review → PR → review loop → merge →
monitor CI. The hard rules in `AGENTS.md` (interop terms, identity, secrets,
CSP) are non-negotiable.

## Dev setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roshangautam/genie.git
cd genie
corepack enable                # or: npm i -g pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev                       # boots the MCP server on stdio
pnpm test                      # run the suite
```

Requires Node ≥ 22.19.0 (CI tests 22/24). `.nvmrc` pins 22.19.0.

## Integration tests

The end-to-end conformance suite lives in `packages/e2e` and drives the MCP
server through the SDK's in-process `InMemoryTransport` — a real MCP client
talking to a real `createServer()`, no network. It is the milestone-level
"do the tools compose?" check that complements the per-tool unit tests in
`packages/server`.

```bash
pnpm test                                        # runs unit + e2e together (root vitest)
pnpm --filter @genie/e2e typecheck               # type-check the suite in isolation
npx vitest run packages/e2e/test                 # just the e2e conformance walk
VITEST_JUNIT=1 npx vitest run packages/e2e/test  # + write reports/junit.xml (CI artefact)
```

- The suite must stay **green and fast** (< 60 s wall-clock; the current M1 walk
  is milliseconds). A dedicated `AC9` test asserts a generous in-band budget on
  the heaviest end-to-end walk so a real regression trips before the 60 s ceiling
  does. Each test spawns an isolated temp `projectsRoot`/`kitsRoot`, so runs never
  touch a real `.genie/` and are safe to run in parallel.
- **Test report:** set `VITEST_JUNIT=1` (CI sets it automatically) to emit a
  JUnit XML report at `reports/junit.xml`. CI archives it as the
  `test-report-node-<v>` build artefact. A plain local `pnpm test` writes no
  report and keeps vitest's readable console output.
- Coverage grows tool-by-tool. Walks that depend on an **unmerged** upstream tool
  — or on infra not yet available, like the `GitHostStore`/Gitea parity leg
  (tracked in its own follow-up issue) — are `it.todo(...)` naming the blocking
  issue, never silently skipped. The file doubles as the live M1 checklist: when
  you land a tool (or the infra) that unblocks a `todo`, convert it to a real
  assertion in the same PR.

## Commit convention

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). The type prefix
determines the release bump via release-please:

- `feat:` → minor bump
- `fix:` → patch bump
- `feat!:` / `fix!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` → major bump
- `chore:` / `docs:` / `test:` / `refactor:` / `ci:` → no release

Scope is optional but nice: `feat(server): add list_kits tool`.

## Code style

- TypeScript, ESM, `strict` mode. No `any` without a comment justifying it.
- Prefer explicit over clever. Small, focused modules.
- Prettier + ESLint are the source of truth; run them before pushing.

## Reviews

PRs are reviewed by the maintainer and/or an AI review agent (GitHub Copilot is
the designated reviewer, per `AGENTS.md` §7). Address review comments and
re-request; nothing merges with open comments or red CI.
